The javaFX User Interface uses dialogs (pop-up screens) when invalid options are chosen (example: set the volume to 100 while the maximum is 10). To be able to use dialogs (pop-up screens) in your javaFX applications you should
download this controlsfx-8.0.6_20.jar : 
  https://github.com/marcojakob/tutorial-javafx-8/releases/download/v1.0/controlsfx-8.0.6_20.jar
  (you could also get it from the ControlsFX Website).
Create a lib subfolder in the project and add the controlsfx-jar file to this folder.
Add the library to your project's classpath: In Eclipse right-click on the jar file | Build Path | Add to Build Path. Now Eclipse knows about the library.
